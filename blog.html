                What are differences between local storage & session storage?
            </summary>
            <div>
                Their main difference is that local storage data does not expire, whereas session storage data gets
                cleared when the user closes its browser window. Page sessions are valid for only one tab at a time. So,
                if a user has three tabs open, each one will have its own page session. Since local storage is not
                session-based, all the data must be deleted via javascript or manually. Local storage is best for
                storing data you want to keep long term, even after the user has closed the tab or browser.Session
                storage is best for storing temporary data or data that should only be accessible from one tab.

                What are differences between global scope & local scope?
            </summary>
            <div>
                The scope of a variable refers to the area of the script where it appears. There are two types of
                variables: global and local. A global variable exists only once in a script, and it is visible in every
                function. The scope of a local variable, however, is limited: it exists only within the block in which
                it is declared.Global variables can be accessed and modified anywhere in the program. You cannot access
                local variables outside of the function statement. Global variable and local variable can have the same
                name without affecting each other. JavaScript does not allow block level scope inside {} brackets.

                How does javascript event loop work?
            </summary>
            <div>
                The event loop is a process that waits for the Call Stack to be clear before pushing callbacks from the
                Task Queue to the Call Stack. Once the Stack is clear, the event loop triggers and checks the Task Queue
                for available callbacks. If there are any, it pushes it to the Call Stack, waits for the Call Stack to
                be clear again, and repeats the same process.

                How many ways can we get undefined in javascript?
            </summary>
            <div>
                Undefined is a property of the global object. It is a variable in global scope. The initial value of
                undefined is the primitive value undefined. In all non-legacy browsers, undefined is a non-configurable,
                non-writable property. (Even when this is not the case, avoid overriding it.).The undefined property
                indicates that a variable has not been assigned a value, or not declared at all.Accessing an
                uninitialized variable returns undefined. [Accessing a non-existing property of an object returns
                undefined. Accessing a out-of-bounds array element returns undefined.A function without a return
                statement or with a return statement but without an expression returns undefined.]
