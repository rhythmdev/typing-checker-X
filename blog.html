                How do you create an accordion?
            </summary>
            <div>
                Easy! As long as you don't have to support IE11 or older browsers you could use <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code> natively.
            </div>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>
                What if I have to support IE11 or older browsers?
            </summary>
            <div>
                No worries. The fallback for these elements is quite good. They will display as open. You won't get the open/close mechanism, but you won't lose any content either.
            </div>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>
                What type of content can I have inside one of these?
            </summary>
            <div>
                Almost anything you'd like. The <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> element allows all <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Content_categories#flow_content" target="_blank">flow content</a>, which is basically everything.
            </div>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>
                How does it work?
            </summary>
            <div>
                The <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> element encapsulates the <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code> element. The <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code> becomes the 'label' for the <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> and acts like a button. When clicked, the attribute <code>open</code> is added to the <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> element, making it display. You can therefore style the open and closed states seperately if you'd like.
